Chapter 13: Directory Operations
A) Moving Around the Directory Tree
   chdir - change directory, default is $_
B) Globbing
   Normally, the shell expands any filename patterns on each command line into
   the matching filenames. This is called globbing. In fact, anything you can
   say on the command line, you can also put as the (single) argument to glob,
   including multiple patterns separated by apaces.
   e.g. my @all_files_including_dot = glob '.* *';
C) An Alternate Syntax for Globbing
   It used the angle-bracket syntax, similar to reading from a filehandle:
   	  my @all_files = <*>; # exactly the same as my @all_files = glob "*";
   If the item between the angle brackets is strictly a Perl identifier, it's
   a filehandle read; otherwise, it's a globbing operation.
   e.g. my @files = <FRED/*>; # a glob
   		my @lines = <FRED>;   # a filehandle read
		my @lines = <$fred>;  # a filehandle read
		my $name = 'FRED';
		my @files = <$name/*>; # a glob
   The one exception is if the contents are a simple scalar variable(not an
   element of a hash or array) that's not a filehandle object, then it's an
   indirect filehandle read, where the variable contents give the name of the
   filehandle you want to read:
   		my $name = 'FRED';
		my @lines = <$name>;	# an idirect filehandle read of FRED handle
D) Directory Handles
   Another way to get a list of names from a given directory is with a
   directory handle. A directory handle looks and acts like a filehandle. You
   open it(with opendir), you read from it(with readdir), and you close
   it(with closedir). And you're reading the names of files in a directory.
   e.g. open dir my $somedir, $dirname or die "Cannot open $dirname: $!";
   		while(my $name = readdir $somedir)
		{
			next if $name =~ /^\./;		# skip over dot files
			$name = "$dirname/$name";	# patch up the path
			next unless -f $name and -r $name;	# only readable files
			...
		}
E) Recursive Directory Listing
   Perl comes with a nice library called File::Find for nifty recursive
   directory processing. If you are already using Unix find commands to get
   work done, you can convert them to Perl programs with find2perl program
   that comes with Perl. You give it the same arguments that you use with find
   and it spits out the equivalent Perl program:
   $ find2perl . -name '*.pm'
   For more complex things, you might want to look at some CPAN modules,
   including File::Find::Rule and File::Finder. Each of these tries to provide
   a more convenient interface to File::Find.
F) Manipulating Files and Directories
G) Removing Files
   In Perl, you use the unlink operator with a list of the file that you want
   to remove:
   e.g. unlink 'slate', 'bedrock', 'lava';
   		unlink qw(slate bedrock lava);
   Since unlink takes a list, and the glob function returns a list, you can
   combine the two to delete many files at once:
   e.g. unlink glob '*.o'; # this is similar to rem *.o in shell
H) Renaming Files
   syntax: rename 'old', 'new';
   Some people like to use the fat arrow to remind which way the rename
   happens:
   rename 'over_there/some/place/some_file' => 'some_file';
I) Links and Files
   Perl uses link function to create a hard link:
   e.g. link 'chicken', 'egg' or warn "Can't link chicken to egg: $!";
   Perl uses symlink function to create a symbolic link:
   e.g. symlink 'dodgson', 'carroll' or warn "Can't symlink dodgson to
   		carroll: $!";
J) Making and Removing Directories
   Perl uses mkdir function to make directory:
   e.g. mkdir 'fred', 0755 or warn "Cannot make fred dirctory: $!";
   The second argument 0755 is an octal permission number. If you leave the
   leading 0, it will be treat as 1363 in octal, which is a strange
   permission. To avoid this, you better to use the oct() function:
   e.g. my $name = "fred";
   		my $permission = "0755"; # danger ... 
		mkdir $name, $permission; # won't work as you expected
		mkdir $name, oct($permission); # a better and safer way
   Perl uses rmdir function to remove empty directory.
K) Modifying Permission
   Perl uses chmod to change permission like Unix
   e.g. chmod 0755, 'fred', 'barney';
   Symbolic permissions(like +x or go=u-w) accepted by Unix chmod command are
   not valid for the chmod function in Perl.
L) Changing Ownership
   Perl uses chown to change the ownership and group membership:
   e.g. my $user = 1004;
   		my $group = 100;
		chown $user, $group, glob '*.o';
   If you have a username like merlyn instead of a number, just call getpwnam
   function to translate the name into a number, and the corresponding
   getgrnam to translate the group name into its number:
   e.g. defined(my $user = getpwnam 'merlyn') or die 'bad user';
   		defined(my $group = getgrnam 'users') or die 'bad group';
		chown $user, $group, glob '/home/merlyn/*';
   The defined function verifies that the return value is not undef, which
   will be returned if the requested user or group is not valid.
M) Changing Timestamps
   In those rare cases when you want to lie to other grogramers when a file
   was most recently modified or accessed, you can use the utime function to
   fudge the books a bit. The first two arguments give the new access time and
   modification time, while the remaining arguments are the list of filenames
   to alter to those timestamps.
   e.g. my $now = time;
   		my $ago = $now - 24 * 60 * 60; # seconds per day
		utime $now, $ago, glob '*'; # set access to now, mod to a day ago
   The third timestamp (the ctime value) is always set to "now" whenever
   anything alters a file, so there's no way to set it(it would have to be
   reset to "now" after you set it) with the utime function. That's because
   it's primary purpose is for incremental backups: if the fil's ctime is
   newer than the date on the backup tape, it's time to back it up again.

Summary:
Nothing special to summary. All details are given.

Exercises:
1) Write a program to ask the user for a dirctory name, then change to that
   directory. If the user enters a line with nothing but whitespace, change to
   his or her home directory as a default. After changing, list the ordinary
   directory contents(not the items whose names begin with a dot) in
   alphabetical order.(Hint: will that be easier to do with a directory handle
   or with a glob?) If the directory change doesn't succeed, just alter the
   user - but don't try showing the contents.
   File Name: mychdir.pl
2) Modify the program to include all files, not just the ones that don't begin
   with a dot.
   File Name: dirListGlob.pl
3) If you used a directory handle for the previous exercise, rewrite it to use
   a glob. Or vise versa.
   File Name: dirListHandle.pl
4) Write a program that works like rm, deleting any files named on the command
   line. 
   File Name: myrm.pl
5) Write a program that works like mv, renaming the first command-line
   argument to the second command-line argument. Remember to allow for the
   destination to be a directory; if it is, use the same original basename in
   the new directory.
   File Name: mymv.pl
6) If your operation systems supports it, write a program that works like ln,
   making a hard link from the first command-line argument to the second. If
   your system doesn't have hard links, just print out a message telling which
   operation you would perform if it were available.
   File Name: myln.pl
7) If your operating system supports it, fix up the program from the previous
   exercise to allow an optional -s switch before the other arguments to
   indicate that you want to make a soft link instead of a hard link.
   File Name: mysln.pl
8) If your operating system supports it, write a program to find any symbolic
   links in the current directory and print out their values(like ls -l would:
   name -> value).
   File Name: slinks.pl
