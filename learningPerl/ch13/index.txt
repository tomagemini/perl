Chapter 13: Directory Operations
A) Moving Around the Directory Tree
   chdir - change directory, default is $_
B) Globbing
   Normally, the shell expands any filename patterns on each command line into
   the matching filenames. This is called globbing. In fact, anything you can
   say on the command line, you can also put as the (single) argument to glob,
   including multiple patterns separated by apaces.
   e.g. my @all_files_including_dot = glob '.* *';
C) An Alternate Syntax for Globbing
   It used the angle-bracket syntax, similar to reading from a filehandle:
   	  my @all_files = <*>; # exactly the same as my @all_files = glob "*";
   If the item between the angle brackets is strictly a Perl identifier, it's
   a filehandle read; otherwise, it's a globbing operation.
   e.g. my @files = <FRED/*>; # a glob
   		my @lines = <FRED>;   # a filehandle read
		my @lines = <$fred>;  # a filehandle read
		my $name = 'FRED';
		my @files = <$name/*>; # a glob
   The one exception is if the contents are a simple scalar variable(not an
   element of a hash or array) that's not a filehandle object, then it's an
   indirect filehandle read, where the variable contents give the name of the
   filehandle you want to read:
   		my $name = 'FRED';
		my @lines = <$name>;	# an idirect filehandle read of FRED handle
D) Directory Handles
   Another way to get a list of names from a given directory is with a
   directory handle. A directory handle looks and acts like a filehandle. You
   open it(with opendir), you read from it(with readdir), and you close
   it(with closedir). And you're reading the names of files in a directory.
