Chapter 10: More Control Structures
A) The unless Control Structure
   Using unless says to run the block of code unless the condition is
   true. It's just like using an if test with the opposite condition.
   a) The else Clause with unless
B) The until Control Structure
   until is just the reverse of while loop
C) Expression Modifiers
   In order to have a more compact notation, an expression may be followed by
   a modifier that controls it.
   e.g. print "$n is a negative number.\n" if $n < 0;
   Perl only allows a single expression on either side of the modifier. You
   can't put multiple statements on the left of the modifier. With the foreach
   modifier, there's no way to choose a different control variable - it's
   always $_.
D) The Naked Block Control Structure
   The so-called "naked" block is one without a keyword or condition. One
   feature of naked block is to provide a scope for temporary lexical
   variables. 
   e.g. {
			print "Please enter a number: ";
			chomp(my $n = <STDIN>);
			my $root = sqrt $n; #calculate the square root
			print "The square root of $n is $root.\n";
		}
		In this block, $n and $root are temporary variable scoped to the block.
E) The elsif Clause
F) Autoincrement and Autodecrement
   a) The Value of Autoincrement
   	  preincrement: increment before assign the value.
	  e.g. my $m = 5;
	  	   my $n = ++$m; # increment $m to 6 first, then assign value to $n
		   	  	   		 # so $m and $n are both 6 now
	  postincrement: increment after assign the value
	  e.g. my $d = $m++; # assign $m to $d first, then increment $m
	  	   	  	   		 # so, $d is still 6 and $m is now 7
G) The for Control Structure
   a) The Secret Connection Between foreach and for
H) Loop Controls
   a) The last Operator
   b) The next Operator
   c) The redo Operator
   d) Labeled Blocks
I) Logical Operators
   a) The Value of a Short Circuit Operator
   b) The defined-or Operator
   c) Control Structures Using Partial-Evaluation Operators
