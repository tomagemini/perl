Chapter 7: In the World of Regular Expressions
A) What Are Regular Expressions?
   A regular expression, often called a pattern in Perl, is a template that
   either matches or doesn't match a given string.
B) Using Simple Patterns
	a) Unicode Propterties
	   see ch7eg1.pl
	b) About Metacharacters
	   Using backslash(\) to escape metacharacters.
	c) Simple Quantifiers
	   '.' means any character, '*' means 0 or more, '+' means 1 or more.
	d) Grouping in Patterns
	    1) You can use back references to refer to the text that you matched in
	   	   the parentheses, called a capture group. You denote a back reference
		   as a back slash followed by a number like \1, \2, and so on. This is
		   also know as registers in some language.
		2) With the \g{N} notation, you can also use negative numbers, which
		   is also called a relative back reference.
		3) In order to indentify which group gets which number, just count the
		   order of opening parentheses and ignore the nesting.
		4) see ch7eg2.pl
	e) Alternatives
	   '|' is the alternatives in regex.
C) Character Classes
   A character class, a list of possible characters inside square
   brackets([]), matches any single character from within the class. It
   matches just one single character, which can be any one in the bracket.
   e.g. [a-zA-Z] means all alphabet characters
	a) Character Class Shortcuts
	   Those shortcuts starts with a backslash(\).
	   e.g. \d stands for all digits, \w stands for alphanumeric, etc.
	b) Negating the Shortcuts
	   Capitalize means negation.
	   e.g. \D means all but not digits, and so on.
	   '^' within the square brackets also means negation.
	   e.g. [^\d] means same as [\D]

Summary:
Nothing Special in this chapter. All of them just basic regex knowledges.

Exercises:
1) Prints each line of inputs that mentions fred. Make a small text file to
   test it.
   File Name: showfred.pl
2) Modify the previous program to all Fred matchs as well.
   File Name: showfredi.pl
3) Prints each line of inputs that contains '.' and ignores other lines.
   File Name: showdot.pl
4) Prints each line of inputs that is capitalized but not ALL capitalized.
   File Name: showCap.pl
5) Prints each line that has two of the same nonwhitespace characters next to
   each other. e.g. Mississipi, Bamm-bamm, or llama.
   File Name: showdouble.pl
6) Prints any input line that metions both wilma and fred.
   File Name: showextra.pl
