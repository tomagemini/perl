Chapter 12: File Tests
A) File Test Operators
   Table 12-1. File tests and their meanings
   see ch12eg1.pl
   a) Testing Several Attributes of the Same File
   	  Virtual filehandle _(underscore) uses the information from the last file
	  lookup that a file test operator performed.
   b) Stached File Test Operators
B) The stat and lstat Functions
   stat returns about all information about a file. The return value is an
   empty list if stat failed, or a 13-element list:
   e.g. my($dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid, $rdev, $size, $atime,
   		   $mtime, $ctime, $blksize, $blocks) = stat($filename);
   $dev and $ino - The device number and inode number of the file. Together
   they make up a "license plate" for the file. They are always unique.
   $mode - the set of permission bits for the file, and some other bits.
   $nlink - The number of (hard)links to the file or directory.
   $uid and $gid - The user id and group id
   $size - the size in bytes, as returned by the -s file test
   $atime, $mtime, $ctime - The file access time, modified time and create
   time.
   lstat works for the symbolic link for certain file.
C) The localtime Function
   see ch12eg2.pl
D) Bitwise Operators
   Table 12-2. Bitwise operators and their meanings
   Expression  Meaning
   10 & 12	   Bitwise-and -- this gives 8
   10 | 12	   Bitwise-or -- this gives 14
   10 ^ 12	   Bitwise-xor -- this gives 6
   6 << 2	   Bitwise shift left -- this gives 24
   25 >> 2	   Bitwise shift right -- this gives 6
   ~10	 	   Bitwise negation, also called unary bit complement -- return
   			   the number with the opposite bit for each bit in the operand.
			   This gives 0xFFFFFFF5
   a) Using Bitstrings

Summary:
Nothing special to summary. All details are given.

Exercises:
1) Make a program that takes a list of files named on the command line and
   reports for each one whether it's readable, writable, executable, or
   doesn't exist.
   File Name: fileTester.pl
2) Make a program to identify the oldest file named on the command line and
   report it's age in days.
   File Name: oldestFile.pl
3) Make a program that uses stacked file test operators to list all files
   named on the command line that are readable, writable, and owned by you.
   File Name: myfileTester.pl
