Chapter 8: Matching with Regular Expressions
A) Matches with m//
B) Match Modifiers
   See ch8eg1.pl for examples regarding the following subtitles
	a) Case-Insensitive Matching with /i
	b) Matching Any Character with /s
	   It changes every dot in the pattern to act like [\d\D], which is to
	   match any character including the newline character
	c) Adding Whitespace with /x
	d) Combining Option Modifiers
	e) Choosing a Character Interpretation
	   If you have the ordinal 0xBC, is that Latin-9 or Latin-1 or something
	   else in some other locale. You can't know how to manipulate it until
	   you know what it represent in the locale.
	   e.g.
		$_ = <STDIN>;
	   	my $OE = chr(0xBC); # get exactly wha we intend
	   	if(/$OE/li) # that's better
	   	{
			print "Found $OE\n";
	   	}
	   In this case, you might get different results depending on how Perl
	   treats the string in $_ and the string in match operator
	f) Other Options
C) Anchors
   \A means beginning of the string
   \Z means end of the string
   \z means absolute end of the string, which means nothing can come after \z
   even the newline character
   ^ means beginning of the line (in Perl 5)
   $ means end of the line (in Perl 5)
   In Perl 4 and before ^ \A and $ \Z functions about the same without /m. In
   Perl 5, ^ and $ can make difference with the multiline matching option /m. 
   e.g. /fred$/m
   In Perl 5, it matches any line end with fred including multiline
   In Perl 4, it matches fred anywhere as long as it's either followed by a
   newline anywhere in the string, or is at the absolute end of the string.
	a) Word Anchors
	   \b means word boundary.
	   e.g. /\bhunt/ will match hunt or hunting, but not shunt
	   		/stong\b/ will match sandstone or flintstone, but not capstones
D) The Binding Operator =~
   see ch8eg2.pl for examples
   The binding operator has fairly high precedence. So,
   	   my $likes_perl = <STDIN> =~ /\byes\b/i
   will do the pattern test first, but not assign the STDIN to variable first.
E) Interpolating into Patterns
   see ch8eg2.pl for examples
   The pattern operator acts just as if it were a double-quoted string.
F) The Match Variables
   Like groups pattern using back reference, match variables use $1 $2 etc.
   see ch8eg3.pl for examples.
	a) The Presistence of Captures
	   
	b) Noncapturing Parentheses
	c) Named Captures
	d) The Automatic Match Variables
G) General Quantifiers
H) Precedence
	a) Examples of Precedence
	b) And There's More
I) A Pattern Test Program
